# Morse Torch

Morse Torch is a Swift-based iOS application designed to provide essential Morse code communication tools. Whether you need to transmit messages in challenging situations or simply want to explore the world of Morse code, Morse Torch has you covered.

## Features

### Text-to-Morse Translator
Effortlessly convert your text messages into Morse code. Morse Torch ensures accurate translation for effective communication.

### Flashlight Flashing
Activate the built-in flashlight to transmit Morse code signals visually. This feature is particularly useful in low-light conditions or emergencies.

### Morse Code-to-Text Converter
Harness the power of computer vision to decode Morse code from visual signals. Simply point your device's camera at the Morse code, and Morse Torch will translate it into readable text.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/morse-torch.git
    ```

2. **Open in Xcode**
    ```bash
    cd morse-torch
    open MorseTorch.xcodeproj
    ```

3. **Build and Run**
    Press `Cmd + R` to build and run the application on your preferred iOS simulator or device.

## Usage

1. Enter text in the "Text to Morse" section.
2. Tap "Translate" to convert the text into Morse code.
3. Toggle the flashlight option to visually transmit Morse code.
4. For Morse-to-Text conversion, switch to the "Morse to Text" section.
5. Use the computer vision functionality to decode Morse code from visual signals.
